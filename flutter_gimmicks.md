Flutter comes with super complex build system that ties in all the language runtimes with dart and the native rendering engine. So, naturally there is a tradeoff between having to build all these things and being slow or reusing builds and being fast but occassionally wrong.
Flutter I think, errs on the latter. So, most times when you feel like flutter is not doing something you think it should be doing, it is because the build got messed up.

Flutter dependency problem:

If there is a dependency problem, don't have pinned dependencies and have the dependency resolver do the heavy lifting for you.
